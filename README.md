# Web-Chat-Application
In this project, I developed a real-time chat application. The goal was to create a web-based chat platform where users can join chat rooms, exchange messages in real-time, and have a smooth and interactive chat experience. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this project.
___

## User Interface:
● Created an intuitive and visually appealing user interface for the chat application
using HTML and CSS.

● Designed a chat room interface with a list of available rooms, a message display
area, and an input field for sending messages.

● Ensured responsive design to accommodate different screen sizes.
___

## Real-Time Communication:
● Implemented real-time communication between users using JavaScript and
WebSockets.

● Users are able to select a chat room to join and exchange messages with
other users in that room.

● Messages appear in real-time without the need to refresh the page.
___

## User Authentication:
● Implemented user authentication to allow users to choose a username before joining
a chat room.

● Users are not able to impersonate others or use the same username
simultaneously.
___

## Chat Features:
● Allowed users to send text messages in chat rooms.

● Provided a way to see who sent each message, and timestamp each message.

● Implemented basic text formatting (e.g., bold, italics, links) in chat messages.
___

## Room Management:
● Allowed users to create new chat rooms and join existing ones.

● Displays the list of available chat rooms, and users should be able to select a room
to join.
___

## User Experience:
● Ensured a smooth and user-friendly experience with features like message scrolling
and notifications for new messages.

● Handled edge cases, such as empty messages and room selection.
___

## Additional Considerations:
● Paid attention to security, especially regarding user authentication and data validation.

● Handled situations where users disconnect or join the chat.

● Used external libraries or frameworks, and the core functionality
is implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
